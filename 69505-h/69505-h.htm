<hr class="chap">

<p>Dr. John Bartok replaced the test tube carefully in its rack with
fingers that shook a little. His pleasant, plump-cheeked face had the
blank look of a man who has had too great a shock to assimilate, so
that for the moment he feels nothing.</p>

<p>He got to his feet. Absently he ran stained, spatulate-tipped fingers
through his thinning blond hair and groped for a cigarette. The liquid
in the test tube caught a pinpoint of light from the fluorescents and
thin fumes escaped upwards from its surface. Dr. Bartok shuddered
slightly and turned toward the broad plate glass window that spread
clear across the front of the chrome and enamel lab.</p>

<p>Behind him the swinging door squeaked. A hearty voice boomed greeting.
"Well, John!"</p>

<p>Dr. Goodwin, head of the Nelson Foundation, thought it part of his
duties to boom heartily. He was a plump man in morning coat and
striped trousers with the inevitable pince-nez on a black ribbon. He
was a greeter, a hand-pumper, a speech-maker and a born politician.
He was also a surprisingly able physicist. His work on gamma and
beta particles, publicized by his own skilled hand, had won him the
directorship of the Nelson Foundation. He gave his men a free hand in
their research, but he thought it his right to snoop into their work at
all times so that few of them had any illusion of freedom.</p>

<p>John Bartok did not turn. "I've got it, Dr. Goodwin," he said and
continued to look out the window.</p>

<p>The manicured lawns of the Nelson Foundation were a well ordered green
in the spring sunshine. A marble wing of the building rose to his
right. Through the slits of partly-drawn blinds he could see laboratory
workers at their jobs. Below, a girl assistant walked briskly along
one of the curving paths that wound through the flower beds, her white
stockings and shoes twinkling under the crisp blue of her cape.</p>

<p>"Got it? You've got it?" Goodwin repeated.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Bartok turned and placed his back to the window, releasing his grasp on
the sanity of sun and grass.</p>

<p>"The new weapon," he said flatly. "The final—the irresistible weapon.
The thing we've been searching for ever since the stalemate of the atom
bomb."</p>

<p>Excitement flamed in Goodwin's round face. His color mounted. "Where?
What is it?" he demanded. "I'll phone General McComber!"</p>

<p>Bartok jerked his cigarette towards the test tube, which still gave off
faint white fumes.</p>

<p>"This?" Goodwin stared at it fascinated. "It's—"</p>

<p>"It's the deadliest thing a man's imagination could ever hope to
conceive," Bartok said flatly. He was not boasting. He was stating a
simple fact. "Beside it the atom bomb is like a child's pea-shooter."</p>

<p>Goodwin edged back instinctively.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's harmless enough by itself," Bartok said. "It's a catalyst.
Add it to something else, and—" He drew a deep breath. "Remember the
scare the atom bomb threw into the world? And the menace of radioactive
dust? And germ warfare? Remember people talking about the end of
the human race as though it were just around the corner?" He nodded
gloomily at the test tube. "Well, there it is, the real thing, if that
stuff ever gets loose."</p>

<p>The uneasiness had fled Goodwin's face. His jowls were alight with
excitement. He seized Bartok's hand, pumping it like a driveshaft.</p>

<p>"Congratulations," he beamed. "This puts us at the top of the heap
again. It'll mean a lot to the Nelson Foundation, John. And to you.
I've got to call the War Department!"</p>

<p>On his way to the door he stopped, turned back. "By the way," he asked.
"What is it you add that stuff to, to make it the potent weapon?"</p>

<p>Bartok shifted his eyes and looked unhappy. "I'd rather not say," he
muttered. "Not till I think this out a little more."</p>

<p>"Think what out?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid of that stuff," Bartok said reluctantly. "It's—it's far
more dangerous—well, sir, this time it's not just scare talk. It
really could mean the end of man, the end of the world!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Goodwin said. "That's not for you to judge, John! We've got
to turn it over to the War Department! It will make us the strongest
nation on earth, give us control! Just the threat of having it will be
enough. We won't have to use it!"</p>

<p>Bartok gave him a cynical glance and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Look." Goodwin's plump finger pointed to a newspaper lying open on a
lab bench. Headlines flared.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ph1">ATOMIC WEAPONS NOT TO BE USED</p>

<p class="ph1">REPRISALS FEARED</p>

<p>Top ranking military men believe atomic weapons will not be used in
future wars because belligerents will fear reprisals, it was revealed
today by a confidential source close to high officials in the War
Department. The one way to victory and the best hope of avoiding
war is to maintain the nation's war machine in a state of immediate
readiness.</p>
</div>

<p>"You see?" Goodwin said. "Anything as terrible as you say this is could
never be used. Just having it—and letting other nations know we have
it—is insurance against anybody jumping on us. Keep them scared to
death."</p>

<p>He beamed upon the silent Bartok. "I'll call General McComber to come
down at once." The swinging door squealed and flapped behind his
confident exit.</p>

<p>Dr. John Bartok took his cigarette and himself into the chair in front
of the lab table and slumped down to stare at the gently fuming test
tube. He was tired and he was confused. He was a little afraid of the
responsibility thrust so suddenly upon him.</p>

<p>There was no simple decision to be made here. He could not deny his
country a weapon it might possibly need desperately in some unknown
future emergency. To withhold it might mean destruction. And to give
it—to turn it over to some thick-necked general who thought of war
principally as a road to promotions and glory? Bartok was under no
illusions as to the average military mind, American or otherwise.</p>

<p>Yet he shrank from the thought of making so great a decision himself,
of bucking the Foundation and the War Department by himself. Perhaps
Goodwin was right, the weapon need never be used. Its threat alone
might be enough. In any case, perhaps Congress or the people, or
the professional trouble shooters, should decide, not John Bartok,
laboratory man.</p>

<p>Miserably he rubbed his hair until it stood up in wild disarray on his
pink scalp. He leaned forward to stare into the sauterne colored fluid.
The fumes rose to his nostrils, they tickled and made him want to
sneeze. Suddenly he was dizzy, the lab began to heave unsteadily about
him.</p>

<p>Alarmed, Bartok pulled back, tried to climb to his feet. The movement
made his head spin wildly. The whole lab floated up into a narrowing
funnel above him and the darkness contracted about him like overlapping
layers of a blanket.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After a long time there was light. He opened heavy lids to see a red
glow of sun. Somewhere there was a guttural, familiar chanting. The
smell of woodland was in his nostrils. Under him the foam rubber
cushion had grown suddenly hard and uncomfortable. His vision cleared
and amazement froze him.</p>

<p>He was squatted on a ledge in the face of a rough cliff-like slope.
Before him a red sunset blazed over a wild, jungle-thick forest. Behind
him was a cave mouth in which a fire flickered. From its depths came
the chanting which was so strangely familiar.</p>

<p>Bartok looked down at himself. His limbs were all but naked, only a
wolfskin draped about his hips served as both garment and belt. Arms
and legs were hugely muscled, thick with furry hair. A beard spread its
bushy length upon his hirsute chest.</p>

<p>He was neither alarmed nor frightened. He was Krug of the Cave
Dwellers, and this was his home. Behind him was a bustle and Ngeel, the
chief, came out on the ledge. He was a stocky, powerful man, wearing
the leopard skin of authority, plus a bustling official manner, plus a
belief that his tribesmen were his by right.</p>

<p>Ngeel squatted down beside Krug and chuckled deep in his throat. "They
come, the Forest Men," he grunted. "They think to kill. We shall kill
many and there will be much feasting."</p>

<p>Krug stared, troubled, out over the sea of waving branches. A dim
thought struggled for expression in his mind.</p>

<p>"Always there is fighting," he said. "Always killing. We are men, not
beasts. There is food for all. Must the women always weep for the dead,
must children always wail for mothers and fathers slain?"</p>

<p>Ngeel's bushy eyebrows drew down. "In my father's day," he said, "men
were truly wiser. Now we breed a race of fools. The world is very old,
my father told me, and there has always been war. Men will always kill.
Do you think to stop it with words? If we kill more of the Forest Men
than they kill us, there will be no more war."</p>

<p>Krug shrugged massive shoulders. He leaned back against the rock and
began again to twist and plait some strips of skin.</p>

<p>"What is that?" Ngeel asked.</p>

<p>"Something I am making. I had thought if I took—"</p>

<p>"They come!" Ngeel rose suddenly, began to roar a warning. "They come!"</p>

<p>Out of the forest shadows streamed a broken mass of men. They were
armed with clubs, spears sharpened and hardened in the fire, and
stones. They charged the cliff front.</p>

<p>Stones hurtled down upon them, and they gave ground momentarily,
leaving one or two dark forms stretched out. Then Ngeel and the men of
the Caves swung down the steep slope to give battle.</p>

<p>There was the snarling shock of combat, vicious but short. The
Forest Men broke and fell back to the trees. Ngeel called back his
blood-maddened warriors, who would have followed. The chief was canny,
he knew the Forest Men held the advantage in the shadowy aisles that
were their home.</p>

<p>From the fringes of the wood, the Forest Men shouted taunts, flung an
occasional spear or stone which fell short. The Cave Men huddled at the
base of the cliff, licking their wounds.</p>

<p>Up above, Krug worked busily at his plaiting. Ngeel climbed to his
ledge.</p>

<p>"This is bad," said the chief. "They keep us from hunting, even from
water, if they stay."</p>

<p>"They will not stay," Krug said.</p>

<p>He stood up. In his hand he held the cup-like piece between them. Krug
searched about until he found a round stone about the size of his fist.
He placed it in the leather cup.</p>

<p>As Ngeel watched, hairy mouth agape, Krug began to swing the loaded
contraption round his head. Faster and faster it went, until it
whistled through the air and dissolved into a blur. Then he let one of
the thongs slip from his fingers.</p>

<p>Sheer luck played its part that day as it so often does. Had the stone
fallen harmlessly, the effect would have been lost. But the astonished
cavemen saw the missile scream through the air with a force that no
hand-thrown rock could match. Out, out, it arched, far beyond any man's
throwing distance.</p>

<p>A Forest Man, staring, slack-jawed, was slow to duck. The stone took
him full in the face with sodden crunch. There was a horrid, strangled
scream, he tossed wide his huge arms and fell dead amidst his terror
stricken fellows.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<div class="figcenter illowp83" id="illus" style="max-width: 34.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption">The stone whizzed from the sling, took terrible toll.</div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>With howls of dismay, the Forest Men fled into the shadows of the wood.</p>

<p>Krug was a little astonished himself at the appalling success of his
first attempt. But the effect upon Ngeel was even more striking. Always
the politician, he recovered swiftly.</p>

<p>"This is magic," he said. "It makes us the most powerful tribe in the
land. The Forest Men shall fear us and the men of the marshes and
the river tremble at our name!" Shrewdly he added, "There will be no
more wars, now, Krug. Your magic is too strong. None shall dare stand
against us!"</p>

<p>Musing, he stroked his beard. "Man is old, my father said," he
muttered, "and always there has been war. But now is an end to war, for
with magic that kills at such a distance, war is too terrible. There
will be no more wars!"</p>

<p>And looking down at him, Krug wrestled with the astonishing idea that
by inventing a terrible weapon of war, he had made war impossible. The
weapon was too terrible to use.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>So there was peace. The tribe hunted in the fringes of the forest and
along the river bank and others fled before their approach. There was
peace for the space of a moon.</p>

<p>Then a hunter came racing with the word that the Forest Men were coming.</p>

<p>"Coming?" Ngeel's bushy brows drew down in stupefied disbelief. "They
have forgotten so soon? They need another lesson!"</p>

<p>Confident, Krug stood upon the rocky shelf and waited. And alongside
him stood a dozen warriors of the tribe, all armed with slings, all
trained by him. Each carried smooth round stones in a pouch at his
belt. They were the most terrible fighting force the world had yet seen.</p>

<p>Shadows moved at the edge of the wood, broke free and slid out into the
sunlight.</p>

<p>"They come!" Ngeel grunted.</p>

<p>At Krug's word, the slingmen reached for stones. The slings began to
whirl overhead, rise in pitch to a whistle. Then the missiles arched
out into the air. The Cave Men and their women shouted as the stones
flew. They heard the heavy thump as the projectiles landed. But there
were no screams from the Forest Men, there were no crushed and
bleeding forms stretched upon the grass. The invaders came on.</p>

<p>And now, as they came closer, the Cave Men saw why. Each of the Forest
Men carried before him a round leather shield stretched on a tough
green sapling bent into a hoop. The strong rawhide took the full shock
of a flung stone and let it rebound without harm. Safe behind their
moving forts, the Forest Men came swiftly on, to reach and climb the
wall. And now again came the snarling shock of combat, as men met and
strove hand to hand with club and knife and teeth.</p>

<p>Krug flung down his useless sling and snatched up his club. A Forest
Man rushed upon him with mighty bludgeon upraised. It wavered in the
air and then melted away. Layers of darkness unwrapped about him.
Shining white walls swam and flowed into place to settle solidly. Dr.
John Bartok opened his eyes upon the familiar sights of his laboratory.</p>

<p>He raised his head. The test tube rested as before in its rack. The
thin white fumes curled lazily upward. He drew back in belated alarm.
He could still hear the snarling roar of that savage battle, still
smell the blood and heat of war and death. Good heavens, was it the
fumes? Had they anaesthetized him? Had he dreamed it all?</p>

<p>He found a cigarette and sat back, away from the test tube, brooding.
Snatches of words floated through his mind.</p>

<p>"Too terrible to use—"</p>

<p>"This will end wars—"</p>

<p>"All will fear us. Just having it will be enough. We will never have to
use it."</p>

<p>The cigarette burned down. He got up. His face was pale and set.</p>

<p>The swinging door squeaked and Dr. Goodwin bustled in, face glowing
with excitement.</p>

<p>"John, here's General McComber. He came right down by helicopter when
I told him—John, where is it? John, what are you doing?" His usually
controlled voice rose to a shriek.</p>

<p>Dr. John Bartok turned from the sink. He shook the last few drops of
water from the glass.</p>

<p>"I'm just rinsing out this test tube," he said.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
